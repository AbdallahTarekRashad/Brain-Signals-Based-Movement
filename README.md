# Brain Signals Based Movement
When a person lose his/her one of his/her tip, it would be so default thing, whatever the way. So we are trying to help those people to regain their regular life by developing a Prostheses supported and controlled by their brain. We used the machine learning to develop such solution through taking the signals of the imagine of the movement that the subject wants to do, give it to our first phase which is the preprocessing in which we pick the channels and frequencies that we will work with, then our second phase which is feature extraction in which we used the Common Spatial Pattern(CSP), Independent Component Analysis(ICA) and Principal component analysis(PCA) and our last phase which is classification in which we pass our data to our classification model and start our training using algorithms like Support Vector Machine(SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) and K-Nearest neighbour . We succeeded to get high accuracy (will be discussed later) and a good response.
